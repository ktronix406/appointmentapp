Modify Event Click Handler:

    Update the event click function in FullCalendar to redirect the user to a new page or open a detailed view modal when an appointment is clicked.

Create a Detailed View Page/Modal:

    Design and implement a new HTML page or a modal window that displays detailed information about the appointment. This could include customer details, vehicle information, products installed, prices, and any notes related to the appointment.

Fetch Appointment Details:

    Implement backend logic to fetch detailed information about the appointment when it is clicked. This would involve querying the database with the appointment ID or other unique identifier.

Link to Detailed View:

    Ensure that the event click function in FullCalendar includes a way to pass necessary identifiers (like appointment ID) to the detailed view page or modal.

Styling and Layout:

    Design the layout and style of the detailed view page or modal to ensure it is clear and easy to read. Consider using tabs or sections if there are many details to display.

Navigation and Usability:

    Implement navigation options within the detailed view, such as buttons to edit or delete the appointment, or to go back to the calendar view.

Security and Permissions:

    Check that the user has the appropriate permissions to view detailed appointment information and implement any necessary security measures to protect sensitive data.

Testing:

    Thoroughly test the new feature to ensure it works correctly across different devices and browsers, and that all user interactions are intuitive and error-free.
